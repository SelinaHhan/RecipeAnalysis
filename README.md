## Introduction
Food plays an essential role in our daily livesâ€”not only as nourishment but also as a source of creativity, culture, and comfort. As more people become conscious of their dietary habits and strive to balance convenience with health, the time it takes to prepare meals has become an important consideration. In today's fast-paced world, many home cooks prefer recipes that are quick to make, but we wondered whether this convenience comes at a nutritional cost. Specifically, we aim to investigate whether there is a relationship between cooking time and the amount of calories in a recipe. Are faster meals generally more calorie-dense due to reliance on processed ingredients, or do longer recipes result in richer, higher-calorie dishes? To explore this, we are using two datasets consisting of recipes and reviews from food.com posted since 2008. This dataset was originally compiled for the recommender system research paper Generating Personalized Recipes from Historical User Preferences by Majumder et al., and provides valuable insights into recipe attributes such as cooking time, ingredients, and nutritional information.
